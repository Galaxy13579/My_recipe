      <h4> Now that you have seen how it is done, here is the step-by-step breakdown to follow along at your own pace.</h4>

    <h2> <u>How to do it</u> </h2>
     <ol> 
      <li><strong>Pre-heat the oven </strong>-Set your oven to 180 degrees celcius and let your oven pre heat.(350 degreesFahrenheit)</li>
        <ul><li>Preheating is not just a suggestion. It is your cake's warm-up act. When the batter hits a hot oven, it springs into action, rising evenly and baking to golden perfection. Skip this step, and you risk a moody bake: soggy centers, burnt edges, and a confused cake wondering what went wrong. So give your oven a head start, and let the magic begin! 

        </li></ul>

      <li><strong>Oil your containers with batter and lign them with baking paper.</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Parchment paper is your baking friend! It keeps your cakes from clinging to the pan like a stage-five clinger, so they slide out smooth and flawless. No more scraping, tearing, or praying to the cake gods. Plus, it helps everything bake evenly and makes cleanup a total breeze—just lift, toss, and done. Who knew a humble sheet could be such a hero?
         </li></ul> 
      <li> <strong>Sift you flour and add the salt and baking powder while whisking it. 
        </strong></li>
         <ul><li>Sifting flour is like giving it a breath of fresh air! When you run it through a sifter, you are not just busting up lumps—you are fluffing it up for a smoother, more accurate measurement. That airy texture makes it a dream to mix into batters and doughs, helping everything blend like a charm. Skip the sifting, and you might end up with clumps or a dense bake. So shake it up and let your flour fly free! 
</li></ul>

      <li><strong> In a separate bowl, add your butter and whisk it until it is nice and smooth.
      </strong> </li>
         <ul><li>Whipping in air is like giving your batter a little lift-off! As you mix, tiny bubbles sneak in and work their magic, creating a light, tender crumb that melts in your mouth. This natural leavening gives your baked goods that dreamy texture—turning them from everyday snacks into show-stopping treats. It is the secret ingredient you ca not see but definitely taste! 
</li></ul>

      <li> <strong> your sugar and continue whisking until the mixture is nice and fluffy.
      </strong></li>
         <ul><li>Mixing sugar into your cake batter is not just about sweetness—it is where the magic begins! When you cream it with butter, sugar acts like a tiny whisk, whipping in air that gives your cake that dreamy, cloud-like texture . It also melts into the mix, locking in moisture and creating a tender crumb that practically melts in your mouth. But rush this step, and you risk gritty bits, uneven baking, and a cake that is more flop than fluff. So take your time—your taste buds will thank you! 
         </li></ul>

      <li><strong>Add your eggs one by one while mixing. </strong></li>
         <ul><li>Adding eggs one at a time is like building a strong foundation for your batter . Each egg blends smoothly into the butter-sugar mix, creating a silky emulsion that holds everything together. Rush it, and you risk curdling—a cake's worst nightmare! Gradual mixing also spreads moisture and proteins evenly, giving you a batter that is light, fluffy, and ready to rise to the occasion. 
         </li></ul>

      <li><strong> Add the vanilla extract.</strong> </li>
         <ul><li>Vanilla extract is the secret whisper of flavor in your cake!  Just a splash adds warmth, depth, and a cozy sweetness that ties everything together—from the richness of butter to the sparkle of sugar. It is like the background music that makes the whole dessert sing. Even in tiny doses, vanilla makes your cake smell dreamy and taste unforgettable.
</li></ul>

      <li><strong> Add the flour mixture and milk to the combination alternating to ensure that you get a smooth and consistent mixture.</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Alternating flour and milk is like a graceful kitchen dance add a little dry, then a little wet, and repeat. This rhythm keeps your batter silky smooth and lump-free, while preventing curdling chaos. Dumping all the flour makes it stiff and stubborn; flooding it with milk can cause it to split. But when you alternate, everything blends beautifully, creating a tender, evenly textured cake that is ready to wow. 
         </li></ul>

       </div>
      <li><strong>Continue mixing the mixture with a spatula. </li></strong>
         <ul><li>Do not ditch the spatula just yet—it is your secret weapon for cake perfection! That final mix ensures every last bit of batter is smooth and unified, especially those sneaky pockets at the bottom of the bowl. Gentle folding keeps the texture light and airy, without beating the life out of your cake. Overmixing? That is how you get a dense, chewy flop. So scoop, swirl, and fold with care—your cake will thank you! 
         </li></ul>

      <li><strong>Add your mixture to your containers and pat down.
         </strong></li>
         <ul><li>Give that pan a gentle tap-tap!  Patting your baking container after pouring in the batter is a tiny move with big impact. It shakes loose those sneaky air bubbles that could leave holes or weird textures in your cake. Plus, it smooths out the surface, setting the stage for an even rise and a flawless finish. It is the baker's secret handshake for a cake that looks as good as it tastes! 
         </li></ul>

      <li><strong>Bake in the oven for about forty five minutes then wait for it to cool.
      </strong></li>
         <ul><li>Hold that spatula—your cake needs a breather! Frosting a warm cake is a recipe for a slippery, melty mess. Let it cool, and you will get a firm, crumb-free surface that is ready for a smooth, stunning finish. It is like letting your masterpiece set before adding the final brushstrokes. The result? A cake that looks flawless and tastes even better. 

         </li></ul>

         <ul><li>Cake decorating is where creativity meets celebration!

From swirls of frosting to bursts of color and themed toppers, decorations and personal touches that add an extra sprinkle of joy that makes every slice feel special.

      <h3>Did you enjoy making the cake?</h3>
      <h3><u>Here are some tips and tricks to make the experience easier.</u></h3>

      <h3>Pro Chef Tips for Perfect Vanilla Cake</h3>

     <ul>
      <li><strong>Room Temperature Is Key</strong></li>
         <p>Make sure your butter, eggs, and milk are at room temperature. This helps them blend more evenly, creating a smoother batter and fluffier cake.</p>

      <li><strong> Weigh Your Ingredients</strong></li>
         <p>Use a kitchen scale for accuracy — especially for flour and sugar. Too much flour can make your cake dense, while too little sugar can affect texture and browning.</p>

     <li><strong> Sift for Softness</strong></li>
         <p>Sift your flour, baking powder, and salt together. This aerates the dry ingredients and helps prevent lumps, giving your cake a finer crumb.</p>

      <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar Well</strong></li>
         <p>Beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy — this step traps air and gives your cake a beautiful rise.</p>

      <li><strong>Do not Overmix</strong></li>
         <p>Once you add the flour, mix just until combined. Overmixing can lead to a tough cake.
         </p>

      <li><strong> Tap the Pan</strong></li>
         <p>After pouring the batter into the pan, gently tap it on the counter to release any air bubbles for an even bake.</p>

      <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven</strong></li>
         <p>Always preheat your oven fully before baking. An accurate temperature ensures your cake rises properly and bakes evenly.</p>

      <li><strong>Do not Peek Too Soon</strong></li>
         <p>Avoid opening the oven door in the first 20 minutes — sudden temperature drops can cause your cake to sink.</p>

      <li><strong>Cool Before Frosting</strong></li>
         <p>Let your cake cool completely before frosting to avoid melting or sliding layers.</p>

     </ul>
